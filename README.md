When it comes to writing CSS in a modern JS application, there are a lot of options!
In this course, we'll use styled-components. I chose this option for a few reasons:

- It encourages good habits, and solves whole classes of CSS problems for us, like scoping and specificity.
- It's a very popular tool! styled-components + React is likely the most common combo when it comes to styling in modern JS applications.
- I have a lot of experience, both using it and teaching it.
